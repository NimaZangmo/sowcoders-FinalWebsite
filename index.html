In every corner of the world, people are always acquainted with their thoughts and if they get tangled in their thoughts, people feel mentally challenged. In recent times, Bhutan has stood up to mental health issues. It's not that Bhutan was never having such social issues, there were mental issues before, but people usually tend to believe and just blame it on our karma. They make themselves accept that whatever they are going through, in this life, is because of the deeds of the past. However, others who fails to believe or if the torture to mind is too much, they end up killing themselves. In India, many farmers suicide because they do not achieve the expected yield of the particular year. Because of the draught and sometimes, because they are unable to find the market for their yield, they suicide. The degree of stress and pressure that they undergo is unfathomable because they reach to such extent that they just cannot assure themselves with hope thus suicide. Suicide in Bhutan is no new topic. Even an elderly who is uneducated understand what suicide is. Bhutan is no longer an infant before this issue. A person should be mentally healthy for them to live a happy life.
<br>
One can be mentally healthy but sometimes, they just need that one right person near them when they think the worst of themselves. Recently, a woman in her late 40s died in quarantine not because of any disease or infection but because she was mentally suffering. Also, the youth in the country are time and again facing challenges that make them sturdier and very noob before the fast-changing world. The development in Bhutan is very fast-tracked. This makes the youth feel pressured to make them go along with the time and changes around them. Also, the rural-urban migration has been a great contributing factor which leads to mental challenges. The elderly are more challenged with this as they are left all alone at home when their child goes out for work and comes home late.
<br>
So, what can we do to help those people? The schools in Bhutan have begun with a programme that is very effective and very resourceful. The Peer Helper Program in schools has been a great step that has found its place in the school curriculum. This program selects students who are willing to help others. The students are given training and taught the required skills to deal with their friends. Due to this, the students who are peer helpers are just there for someone who needs help or who needs people to listen to their thoughts. Confidentiality is also one more attribute any listener should have. Since many people do not adhere to confidentiality, many people just do not prefer exchanging or sharing thoughts. So, many people share only to those they trust and that is their friends.

<br>
In my middle school and in my high school, I have been one of the active members of Peer Helper. To be an active member, you need not have to come forward and do extraneous things for a crowd. One can be an active helper if you can help friends and seriously, numbers do not matter at all. Because of my experience and my knowledge about how such a program is helpful, I will be glad to introduce such a program in my college where I will have few students from each class and educate them on the matter. We can never know the next victim of mental health could come from the very college I go to. To prevent or to help those friends of ours, Peer Helping Programe can be very helpful.
<br>
This programe will be our first step in combatting this social issue. It will require our members to go extra with their schedule. The energy they will share or the shoulder they give to those friends will be a great achievement and we will be able to help our friends in any small way possible. If our student is able to use that service of our members then I will be more than happy to extend the activity to the outer community of our college and go beyond the college boundaries little by little thus inculcating it in every citizens of the country where everyone will be a listener or a shoulder to those going through tough times.
